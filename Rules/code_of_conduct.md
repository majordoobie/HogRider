## Our Admin pledge to you <a name="1"></a>

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, age, sex (gender), gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, level or type of experience.

## Our Community Standards <a name="2"></a>

In this community we strive to foster a safe and friendly community for all. To do so, we must encourage behaviours that contribute to esprit de corps. Examples of such behaviours:
- Being kind and courteous to others
- Keeping language at a PG level
- Utilizing a single spoken language of English. Please use DMs for other languages so that no one is left out.
- Requesting permission from original developer before replicating their work. Sharing is encouraged, but we must be ethical about where ideas come from
-  Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Questions should only be asked in the appropriate channels based on context
- Questions will not be answered in DMs. DM conversations only benefit one person. 
- Patiently asking for help without pinging users. When members have time, they will help at their leisure 
  
Examples of unacceptable behaviour:
- The use of sexualized language 
- The use of inappropriate images to include users profile
- Spamming, flaming, or other techniques to acquire attention
- Promotion to other servers or services
- Harassment of any kind

We value more than just expertise in this server, we value collaboration and supporting others above technical skill. The goal of this code of conduct is to define the left and right limits for you to be your best self while in this community.

## Server Technical Policy <a name="3"></a>

The purpose of this policy is to clarify the stance of the Clash API Developers admins’ regarding data mining, asset extraction, API usage and third party tools. This is from the perspective of the admins’ of this discord server and not Supercell, Discord or any other party. This policy may be updated in the future.

---

### Data Mining <a name="3.1"></a>

We regard “Data Mining” to mean the extraction of game values (such as entity costs, upgrade times, attributes etc) from client or API data to enable development of more advanced features for your tools.

<ins>Discussion/sharing of this data is permitted.</ins>

---

### Asset Extraction <a name="3.2"></a>

We regard “Asset Extraction” to mean retrieving images/models from game files for usage in your tools.  Existing asset libraries should be used as a primary source, such as the [Clash of Clans Fankit](http://supr.cl/ClashFanKit).  Additional sources for assets/information are the [Clash of Clans Wiki](https://clashofclans.fandom.com/) and [COC Guide](https://coc.guide/).

<ins>Discussion/sharing of this data is permitted if it is for the betterment of community tool development.</ins>

---

### API Usage <a name="3.3"></a>

We regard “API Usage” to mean querying API endpoints that have been made available to you by the creator of them.  Examples of this include the Clash of Clans API and the Discord API.  Documentation for public endpoints for the Clash of Clans API can be found [here](https://developer.clashofclans.com/).

If you have access to private or enhanced endpoints, it is up to you to decide if you are able to discuss them as part of your agreement with the provider (NDAs etc).

<ins>Discussion of API usage for public endpoints is permitted. Discussion of undocumented endpoints you have discovered should be avoided (check with admins if unsure).</ins>

---

### Third Party Tools <a name="3.4"></a>

We regard “Third Party Tools” to refer to tools that interact directly with the game client, game servers or Discord servers that violate Supercell or Discord ToS.  Examples of these include farm bots, private servers & unofficial clients.

This does not apply to community tools such as Discord bots, websites, applications etc that retrieve/use data through the methods provided officially by Supercell or Discord.

<ins>Discussion or use of third party tools that violate Supercell/Discord ToS is not permitted here.</ins>

---

### Game Update/Content Leaks <a name="3.5"></a>

We regard game content leaks to be information about upcoming game updates or content that didn't originate from an official source, such as Supercell's social media accounts or "Sneak Peeks" from Supercell affiliated content creators.

Discussion or sharing of leaked information is not permitted here.
---

### FAQ <a name="3.6"></a>

Examples I kept in mind when putting this together:

> "Does anyone have costs/upgrade times for X?" - OK

> "Does anyone have an image of TH14 for my discord bot?" - OK

> "Does anyone have an image of the builder for my new game, Smash of Mans" - No

> "Where can I find current war data?" - OK

> "I have access to fast war data and the verify token endpoint (before it was public)" - OK

> "I have found this undocumented API endpoint for authenticating Supercell ID credentials" - No 

> "I want to make a discord bot for tracking farmed resources" - OK

> "I want to make a farm bot" - No
