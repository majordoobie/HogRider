# apibot

Just a little bot we developed to help automate some tasks involving other bots. The primary feature is monitoring.  cogs/downtime.py watches for the bot's Discord presence and if it's anything other than online, it sends the bot owner a message.

cogs/general.py includes a command to create a demo channel for bots on the server
