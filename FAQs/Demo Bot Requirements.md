# Demo Bot Requirements

## Demo Bot Requirements <a name="1"></a>

There are a number of bot demos on this server to demonstrate some of the things that can be achieved using the 
Clash of Clans API.  **It isn't intended to be an advertising platform for your bot.**

To be eligible for consideration as a demo bot, it would need to meet the following requirements:

- Primary focus being a Clash of Clans tool
- Uses the Clash of Clans API
- Discord Verified or Unique features
- Uses Slash Commands
- Only requests permissions that are required
- Has a support server
- Actively developed
- Publicly available
- 99%+ uptime

If you have created a bot that has unique features that you would like adding as a demo bot, please ensure it meets the requirements above and then contact an admin.

If your bot has a particularly unique feature but doesn't meet all of the above requirements, reach out to an admin and we can discuss further.
